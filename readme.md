# SamKenX Smart Contracts

This repository contains the smart contracts for the Turnkey-Triumph-326606_SamKenX decentralized application (dApp). The dApp is a distributed application running on a blockchain network, such as Ethereum, and provides a platform for users to interact with each other and transact without an intermediary.

The smart contracts in this repository are written in Solidity and are used to facilitate the interactions between users and the dApp. They are responsible for handling all of the transactions, validating data, and enforcing the rules of the dApp.

The smart contracts are thoroughly tested using Mocha, Chai, and Truffle to ensure they function as expected. All of the code is open source and available for review.

We hope that these smart contracts provide a secure and reliable platform for users to engage in trustless transactions. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue in the repository.
